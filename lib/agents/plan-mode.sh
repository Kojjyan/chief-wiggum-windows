IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING MODE - READ-ONLY EXPLORATION

You are in READ-ONLY planning mode. Your task is to explore the codebase and create a detailed implementation plan.

PROJECT DIRECTORY: $project_dir
PRD LOCATION: $prd_relative

CRITICAL RULES:
1. READ-ONLY: You MUST NOT modify any files in the project
2. EXPLORATION ONLY: Use Glob, Grep, and Read to understand the codebase
3. SINGLE OUTPUT: You may ONLY write to the file: plan-output.md
4. NO CODE CHANGES: Do not write code, create files, or execute commands that modify state

Your goal is to thoroughly understand:
- What the task requires (from the PRD)
- How the existing codebase is structured
- What patterns and conventions are used
- What files will need to be modified or created
- What dependencies or challenges exist

After exploration, document your findings in plan-output.md following the required format.

IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING TASK:

Create a comprehensive implementation plan by exploring the codebase and analyzing the requirements.

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:

1. **Read the PRD**: Examine @../prd.md to understand what needs to be implemented

2. **Explore the Codebase**: Use Glob, Grep, and Read to understand:
   - Project structure and organization
   - Existing patterns and conventions
   - Related code that will need to be modified
   - Dependencies and integrations

3. **Identify Critical Files**: Determine which files will be:
   - Modified (existing files that need changes)
   - Created (new files that need to be added)
   - Referenced (files to use as patterns/templates)

4. **Analyze Dependencies**: Understand:
   - What order tasks should be done in
   - What depends on what
   - Potential blockers or challenges

5. **Write the Plan**: Create plan-output.md with the following sections:

```markdown
## Overview
[Brief summary of what will be implemented and why]

## Requirements Analysis
[Breakdown of requirements from PRD with acceptance criteria]

## Existing Patterns
[Patterns, conventions, and structures found in the codebase that should be followed]

## Implementation Approach
[Detailed step-by-step approach for implementing each requirement]

## Dependencies and Sequencing
[Order of operations, what depends on what, integration points]

## Potential Challenges
[Technical challenges, edge cases, risks to consider]

### Critical Files
[List of files that will be created or modified, with brief description of changes]
```

IMPORTANT:
- The plan MUST include a "### Critical Files" section
- Be specific about file paths and what changes are needed
- Reference actual code patterns you found in the codebase
- Think through edge cases and potential issues
- The plan should be detailed enough that another developer could implement it

Write your complete plan to: plan-output.md
PROMPT_EOF
    else
        # Subsequent iterations - continue from previous
        cat << CONTINUE_EOF
CONTINUATION OF PLANNING:

This is iteration $iteration of your planning session.

If the plan-output.md file exists, review it and ensure it is complete:
1. Check that all sections are filled in with meaningful content
2. Verify the "### Critical Files" section exists and lists specific files
3. Ensure the implementation approach is detailed and actionable

If the plan is incomplete, continue your exploration and update plan-output.md.
If the plan is complete, no further action is needed.

Remember: This is READ-ONLY mode. Only write to plan-output.md.
