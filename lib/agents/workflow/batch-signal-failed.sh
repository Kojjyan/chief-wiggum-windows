# AGENT_TYPE: batch-signal-failed
# AGENT_DESCRIPTION: Marks the batch as failed in the coordination file,
#   preventing remaining tasks from executing. Pure bash, no LLM involved.
#   Called when a task fails mid-batch to propagate the failure.
# REQUIRED_PATHS:
#   - batch-context.json : Worker's batch context with batch_id
# OUTPUT_FILES:
#   - result.json : Contains PASS (failure signaled successfully)
